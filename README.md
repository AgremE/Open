## Project Description

The goal is to compare between these of two techniques of stylus input namely conventional “tapping” and “circling”. By creating a prototype interface, we asked 9 participants
to test out those techniques of input on said interface. The prototype records the accuracy, operation time, and decision time of the inputs and compare them together using T-tests. The result shows the circling technique is better on accuracy and decision time. However, it requires more operation time. This opens up a new possibilities on how user interacts
with the screen using stylus.

## Requirment

- An Device with windows operative system install and touch screen capability
- Visual Studio 2010 or Above
